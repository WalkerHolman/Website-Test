    <h3>The Holman Mentoring Program begins by outlining the students' goals, both long term and short term, making sure to define measureable checkpoints along the way to ensure that the goal is met. After goals are defined, our mentor will introduce you to material in the subject of your choosing slowly at first but with increasing rigor.</h3>
    <h3>In addition to course material, our mentor will guide you through creating a professional resume, recommend clubs and professional societies depending on your career goals, and will also be available for scheduling and other university-related questions. It is our goal to become not just a tutor but a true mentor in guiding you through the UGA environment.</h3>
