  <h2>Welcome to Holman Mentoring!</h2>
  <p>Hello,</p>
  <p>My name is Walker Holman and I am the owner and founder of Holman Mentoring. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Georgia pursuing a B.S. in Biochemical Engineering and Masters in Business Administration (dual BSE/MBA). Throughout my studies at UGA I have encountered and mastered many difficult courses and have re-taught myself how to learn complex material in ways that I believe everyone can take advantage of.</p>
  <p>At a young age I realized that I was a quick learner, but it was only recently that I began to fully understand and take advantage of what I call “80/20 Learning.” To give a few examples, last semester I taught myself how to memorize playing cards and am now able to memorize a full deck of cards in about 5 minutes, a skill I mastered after only a month of practice. In fact, when I first decided to begin this company I taught myself how to code, host my code on an online server, buy a domain name, and point the domain to my very own (this) website; a feat that many people spend months learning and mastering took me little more than a month.</p>
  <p>Whether you or your child needs to learn Calculus, Organic Chemistry, Accounting, or <a href="Animation.html">Web Development</a> my program will help you to master any subject matter in a fraction of the time that traditional learning would take (HINT: move your mouse over the words 'Web Development'). I have taken time to select only the most accomplished mentors to help guide you or your child through the difficult material that they will encounter at UGA and in the real world.</p> 
  <p>If you are interested in 80/20 learning, or have any questions for my mentors or me, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.</p>
  <div class="Foot">
  <p>Best,</p>
