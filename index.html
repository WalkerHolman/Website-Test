  <h2>Welcome to Holman Mentoring!</h2>
  <p>Hello,</p>
  <p>My name is Walker Holman and I am the owner and founder of Holman Mentoring. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Georgia pursuing a B.S. in Biochemical Engineering and Masters in Business Administration (dual BSE/MBA). Throughout my studies at UGA I have encountered and mastered many difficult courses and have re-taught myself how to learn complex material in ways that I believe everyone can take advantage of. All of my mentors have past experience tutoring, proven track records, and the skills to help you learn difficult material effectively.</p>
  <p>In order to help you or your child succeed at UGA I have developed a tutoring plan that will prime you for success in the sometimes overwhelming university environment. It's important to note that while academic success comes first, succeeding in a university environment means being an active member of the community as well. As the president of the largest fraternity on campus, Delta Sigma Phi, I have ample experience leading in a social setting. As a part of the mentoring program we will help you climb the ladder of any organization of your choosing so that you can have an impact on the community as well as in the classrom.</p>
  <p>Whether you or your child needs to learn Calculus, Organic Chemistry, Resume Building, Accounting, or <a href="Animation.html">Web Development,</a> my program will help you to master any subject matter in a fraction of the time that traditional learning would take (HINT: click on the words 'Web Development'). I have taken time to select only the most accomplished mentors to help guide you or your child through the difficult material that they will encounter at UGA and in the real world.</p> 
  <p>If you are interested in the program, or have any questions for my mentors or me, please do not hesitate to contact me personally.</p>
  <div class="Foot">
  <p>Best,</p>
